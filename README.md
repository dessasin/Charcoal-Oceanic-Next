# Charcoal Oceanic Next
Theme for Visual Studio Code. Optimized for use with [Sublime Babel](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=joshpeng.sublime-babel-vscode).

Based off of Oleg's [Eagle Oceanic Next](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=graf009.Eagle-Oceanic-Next). This theme dims the background and brings in some of Dnld's [Charcoal](https://packagecontrol.io/packages/Charcoal) colors as well as some of my own.
