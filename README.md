# Charcoal Oceanic Next
Theme for Visual Studio Code. Support for ES6 / Babel should improve after VS Code gets around to addressing issue [#3008](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues/3008).

Based off of Oleg's [Eagle Oceanic Next](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=graf009.Eagle-Oceanic-Next). This theme dims the background and brings in some of Dnld's [Charcoal](https://packagecontrol.io/packages/Charcoal) colors as well as some of my own.
